# Demo Event App Task

Welcome to ** Demo Event Task**! This app was created as part of a task to demonstrate React Native development skills.

## Getting Started
>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding. and also 
Before you begin, make sure you have Node.js and Yarn installed.

## Step 1: Clone The Repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/usamabinishaq/rnYouniEVentTask.git
cd rnYouniEVentTask
yarn
```
## Step 2: Start your Application
Let Metro Bundler run in its own terminal. Open a new terminal from the root of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your Android or iOS app:
### For Android
```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn run android
```
### For iOS
```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn run ios
```
If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
